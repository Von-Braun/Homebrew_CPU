# Homebrew_CPU
A record of my homebrew cpu.

I was inspired to design and build my own CPU when I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNN_tTXABUA) and read the book it was based on called **But how do it know?** I spent a long time working on an [RSSB CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_instruction_set_computer#Reverse_subtract_and_skip_if_borrow) and it got quite far into the construction stage as seen in the video below([Some more notes on the RSSB CPU](/RSSB%20notes/)).

However I made the mistake of not running it through enough tests. That coupled with the fact that I'm new to electornics, led to a design which never fully worked. As such its parts were scrapped and used for other things.
